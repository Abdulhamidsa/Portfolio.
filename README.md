**What Knowledge I Have Acquired:** This was an exam project in collaboration with the client, [https://camcamcopenhagen.dk/](https://camcamcopenhagen.dk/) During this project, I learned to use the Next.js App Router and understood how it's different from the Pages Router when it comes to the folder structure and the way of fetching data. I also used Supabase for the database and handled large CSV files. This project improved my full-stack development skills, styling with SCSS, and project management, including effective communication with the client and addressing their needs.
